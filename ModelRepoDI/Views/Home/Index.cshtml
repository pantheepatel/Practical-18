<p>
    This practical includes the implementation of the Models, Repositories, Dependency Injection, and business logic structure as per the given scope.<br />
    UI integration and controller scaffolding have not been performed intentionally, as upcoming practicals will cover:
    <ul>
        <li>Controller scaffolding using Views</li>
        <li>Authentication and Authorization using ASP.NET Identity</li>
    </ul>
    Therefore, no API UI or functional navigation is available in this version.<br />
    The backend structure is fully functional and ready for integration in the next phase.
